I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at McGill University, currently on the 2025–2026 job market. [McGill Economics Department](https://www.mcgill.ca/economics/graduates/instream-students) 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Labour Economics, and Macroeconomics**. <br/>
Most of my [work](../publications) uses Canadian administrative microdata to study **labour market power**, as well as
the **distributional effects of macroeconomic shocks**, and the **fiscal policy** responses designed to mitigate them.


You can find my CV [here](../files/Resume_Guy_Djolaud.pdf). Thanks for your interest!
